Specifically, we used the file:

datamol/data/reactions.json

### Modifications Made:
- Extracted only the `retro_smarts` and `description` fields from the original JSON.
- Removed stereochemical directionality markers (`/` and `\`) from SMARTS strings to simplify parsing and adapt to our current retrosynthesis engine capabilities.
- Reformatted the extracted data into a `.db` format compatible with our RetroChem pipeline.

These modifications were made solely to enable integration into the RetroChem educational retrosynthesis tool.
