    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Organic chemistry is the beating heart of any chemistry curriculum, an immense tapestry of functional groups, transformations, and reaction pathways. With thousands of named reactions and countless mechanistic subtleties to master, the sheer volume of information can overwhelm even the most dedicated student. What better way to tame this complexity than with the power of code?\n",
    "\n",
    "**RetroChem** is our answer: a web-based retrosynthesis assistant that translates familiar IUPAC names or drawn structures into SMILES, and then walks you backward through our hand-curated library of key organic transformations, showing the reagents and conditions required to carry it out. By combining cheminformatics tools (RDKit, SMARTS pattern matching) with interactive web widgets, RetroChem aims to helping you explore, learn, and visualize reaction pathways at the click of a button.  \n",

    "# Databases\n",
    "RetroChem supports multiple reaction databases, each tailored to different levels and domains of organic chemistry. First, we built a handmade database that covers the core reactions taught in the first and second years of the EPFL chemistry curriculum. This includes standard transformations and their associated reaction conditions, helping students review and apply known retrosynthetic logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we integrated a second database sourced from an open-source repository by Datamol (more info on https://github.com/datamol-io/datamol), which focuses on more advanced medicinal chemistry reactions, particularly heterocycle constructions. **This database was parsed using the handmade code available in the file parsing_database.py.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the platform includes a custom database builder that allows users to create or extend their own databases by defining reaction SMARTS and adding experimental conditions. This ensures flexibility and supports both educational and exploratory use cases. This will be discussed more in detail later in the report."

    "RetroChem: Challenges and Features - General Remarks\n",
    "===================================================\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Motivations\n",
    "-----------\n",
    "\n",
    "Organic chemistry is rich in transformations but poor in integrated, student-friendly tooling.  \n",
    "RetroChem was born to‚Ä¶\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Demystify retrosynthesis** - replace static textbook arrows with clickable, data-driven pathways.  \n",
    "* **Bridge theory and practice** - couple SMARTS rules with concrete laboratory conditions.  \n",
    "* **Encourage exploration** - let learners ‚Äúpeel back‚Äù a target molecule step-by-step and see *why* each cut makes chemical sense.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Main Features\n",
    "-------------\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Dual input modes** - type a molecule name *or* sketch it in a Ketcher canvas.  \n",
    "* **One-click retrosynthesis** - generate all first-step disconnections plus reaction conditions.  \n",
    "* **Recursive exploration** - drill down on any reactant to continue the synthetic tree.  \n",
    "* **History navigation** - walk back through previous targets with a single button.  \n",
    "* **Custom database builder** - add new product ‚Üí reactants SMARTS (with conditions) from inside the browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "Challenges Encountered\n",
    "----------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Database building** ‚Äì writing correct forward-reaction SMARTS in our handmade \"epfl_student\" database, then running them in reverse, required meticulous testing. Sourcing, parsing, or hand-entering reliable reaction templates (and their conditions) proved time-consuming.\n",
    "2. **External API reliability** ‚Äì `name_to_smiles` depends on the NCI CIR service; network hiccups needed error handling.  \n",
    "3. **Streamlit session state** ‚Äì juggling multiple nested callbacks (history, builder, main app) demanded a clear state schema to avoid race conditions.  \n",
    "4. **Cross-platform line endings & Git** ‚Äì CRLF/LF conversions occasionally produced noisy diffs and merge conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tools Used\n",
    "----------\n",
    "\n",
    "* **RDKit** - cheminformatics toolkit for SMILES handling, sub-structure search, and reaction execution.  \n",
    "* **Streamlit** - rapid, reactive web UI.  \n",
    "* **streamlit-ketcher** - embedded molecule drawing widget.  \n",
    "* **Pandas** - tabular display of reaction conditions.  \n",
    "* **Python 3.11** - core language and ecosystem.  \n",
    "* **JSON** - storage format for reaction databases (`*.db` files).  \n",
    "* **Git & GitHub** - version control and collaboration.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ways of improvement\n",
    "-------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "RetroChem turns a traditionally chalk-and-talk exercise into an interactive, code-backed learning experience.  \n",
    "While the current version already supports multi-step exploration and on-the-fly database editing, several avenues remain:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Route ranking** - by heuristics (step count, reagent cost, literature frequency).  \n",
    "* **Energetic feasibility** - estimation via semi-empirical calculations.  \n",
    "* **Better stereochemical fidelity** - using enhanced SMARTS and atom-mapping tools.  \n",
    "* **Arrow Pushing** to better visualize the spots of attack.\n",
    "* **Finding the correct spot for mechanism disconnection** - right now, the code only takes the first tuple of reactants from the rdkit function runreactants. Which means it does not show all the possible reactants from a single SMART reaction. Finding the most energetically and kinetically favorable can be a good improvement.\n",
