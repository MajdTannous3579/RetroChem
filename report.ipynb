    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Organic chemistry is the beating heart of any chemistry curriculum, an immense tapestry of functional groups, transformations, and reaction pathways. With thousands of named reactions and countless mechanistic subtleties to master, the sheer volume of information can overwhelm even the most dedicated student. What better way to tame this complexity than with the power of code?\n",
    "\n",
    "**RetroChem** is our answer: a web-based retrosynthesis assistant that translates familiar IUPAC names or drawn structures into SMILES, and then walks you backward through our hand-curated library of key organic transformations, showing each disconnection step along with the reagents and conditions required to carry it out. By combining cheminformatics tools (RDKit, SMARTS pattern matching) with interactive web widgets, RetroChem aims to kick-start the digital revolution in organic synthesis: helping you explore, learn, and visualize reaction pathways at the click of a button.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the future of organic chemistry education. Let’s turn that mountain of reactions into a streamlined, code-driven discovery journey!  \n"

    "| **2 · Closure capture** | The nested `reverser_to_smiles` function *closes over* the compiled `rxn` object **and** its `conditions` dict. | No global look-ups, no re-parsing, fully self-contained. A plain Python call does all the work during search. |\n",
    "| **3 · Fail-fast error handling** | *Invalid SMILES* → `ValueError`; *no products* → returns `None` immediately. | The outer loop (`list_reactants`) never allocates memory for failed matches, so 100 rules × 100 targets still feels instantaneous. ||\n",
    "| **4 · First-match strategy** | Only `prods[0]` is kept; exhaustive enumeration is skipped. | Yields a ~10× speed-up on large SMARTS (good enough for teaching / demo scale). Full enumeration can be toggled on later if needed. |\n",

    "RetroChem: Challenges and Features – General Remarks\n",
    "===================================================\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Motivations\n",
    "-----------\n",
    "\n",
    "Organic chemistry is rich in transformations but poor in integrated, student-friendly tooling.  \n",
    "RetroChem was born to…\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Demystify retrosynthesis** – replace static textbook arrows with clickable, data-driven pathways.  \n",
    "* **Bridge theory and practice** – couple SMARTS rules with concrete laboratory conditions.  \n",
    "* **Encourage exploration** – let learners “peel back” a target molecule step-by-step and see *why* each cut makes chemical sense.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Main Features\n",
    "-------------\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Dual input modes** – type a molecule name *or* sketch it in a Ketcher canvas.  \n",
    "* **One-click retrosynthesis** – generate all first-step disconnections plus reaction conditions.  \n",
    "* **Recursive exploration** – drill down on any reactant to continue the synthetic tree.  \n",
    "* **Thumbnail previews** – every SMILES string is paired with a 2 × 2 cm RDKit image for instant recognition.  \n",
    "* **History navigation** – walk back through previous targets with a single button.  \n",
    "* **Custom database builder** – add new reactants → product SMARTS (with conditions) from inside the browser; changes reload instantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Challenges Encountered\n",
    "----------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **SMARTS authoring & atom mapping** – writing correct forward-reaction SMARTS, then running them *in reverse*, required meticulous testing.  \n",
    "2. **Database curation** – sourcing or hand-entering reliable reaction templates (and their conditions) proved time-consuming.  \n",
    "3. **External API reliability** – `name_to_smiles` depends on the NCI CIR service; network hiccups needed graceful error handling.  \n",
    "4. **Stereochemistry & regiochemistry** – SMARTS patterns can over-match; ensuring chemically sensible cuts without an explosion of false positives is still a work-in-progress.  \n",
    "5. **Streamlit session state** – juggling multiple nested callbacks (history, builder, main app) demanded a clear state schema to avoid race conditions.  \n",
    "6. **Cross-platform line endings & Git** – CRLF/LF conversions occasionally produced noisy diffs and merge conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tools Used\n",
    "----------\n",
    "\n",
    "* **RDKit** – cheminformatics toolkit for SMILES handling, sub-structure search, and reaction execution.  \n",
    "* **Streamlit** – rapid, reactive web UI.  \n",
    "* **streamlit-ketcher** – embedded molecule drawing widget.  \n",
    "* **Pandas** – tabular display of reaction conditions.  \n",
    "* **Python 3.11** – core language and ecosystem.  \n",
    "* **JSON** – storage format for reaction databases (`*.db` files).  \n",
    "* **Git & GitHub** – version control and collaboration.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ways of improvement\n",
    "-------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "RetroChem turns a traditionally chalk-and-talk exercise into an interactive, code-backed learning experience.  \n",
    "While the current version already supports multi-step exploration and on-the-fly database editing, several avenues remain:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Route ranking** by heuristics (step count, reagent cost, literature frequency).  \n",
    "* **Energetic feasibility** estimation via semi-empirical calculations.  \n",
    "* **Better stereochemical fidelity** using enhanced SMARTS and atom-mapping tools.  \n",
    "* **Arrow Pushing** to better visualize the spots of attack \n",
    "\n",
    "Even in its present form, RetroChem lowers the barrier to systematic retrosynthetic thinking—helping students swap guesswork for data-driven insight, one click at a time.\n"
