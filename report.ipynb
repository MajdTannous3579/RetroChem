    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Organic chemistry is the beating heart of any chemistry curriculum, an immense tapestry of functional groups, transformations, and reaction pathways. With thousands of named reactions and countless mechanistic subtleties to master, the sheer volume of information can overwhelm even the most dedicated student. What better way to tame this complexity than with the power of code?\n",
    "\n",
    "**RetroChem** is our answer: a web-based retrosynthesis assistant that translates familiar IUPAC names or drawn structures into SMILES, and then walks you backward through our hand-curated library of key organic transformations, showing each disconnection step along with the reagents and conditions required to carry it out. By combining cheminformatics tools (RDKit, SMARTS pattern matching) with interactive web widgets, RetroChem aims to kick-start the digital revolution in organic synthesis: helping you explore, learn, and visualize reaction pathways at the click of a button.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the future of organic chemistry education. Let’s turn that mountain of reactions into a streamlined, code-driven discovery journey!  \n"
